#  ECO GLIDER  
## AI-Enhanced Autonomous UAV for Forest Fire Detection & Post-Fire Reforestation

---

##  Project Overview
**ECO GLIDER** is an AI-enhanced autonomous UAV designed to support **early forest fire detection** and **post-fire reforestation**.  
The project integrates intelligent sensing, autonomous navigation, and an innovative **seed dispersal mechanism** to minimize environmental damage and promote sustainable forest recovery.

##  Objectives
- Detect forest fire conditions at an early stage  
- Enable autonomous aerial monitoring of forest regions  
- Assist post-fire reforestation using automated seed dispersal  
- Reduce human intervention and response time  
- Support environmental conservation through automation  

---

##  System Features
- Autonomous UAV navigation  
- Environmental sensing for fire detection  
- AI-based decision logic  
- Real-time monitoring  
- Automated seed dispersal mechanism  
- Scalable and eco-friendly design

##  Working Principle
1. The UAV autonomously patrols predefined forest zones  
2. Sensors continuously collect environmental data  
3. AI logic analyzes data to detect fire-prone conditions  
4. Alerts are generated for early intervention  
5. After fire containment, seeds are dispersed in affected areas
